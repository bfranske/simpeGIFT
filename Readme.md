# SimpleGIFT

This javascript program assists in the creation of correctly formatted GIFT questions for import into the Moodle LMS. The initial release has substantial limitations including:
1. Supports only multiple choice questions
2. Supports only four answers per question
3. Prints output GIFT format to the page only and does not allow for download of a GIFT text file
4. Supports only one question at a time

The program runs entirely in browser javascript so no web server or server-side scripting is required.

You can demo the program on the Github [project page for this project](https://bfranske.github.io/simpeGIFT/).
